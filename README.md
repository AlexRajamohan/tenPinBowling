# tenPinBowling
A program, which, given a valid sequence of rolls for one line of American Ten-Pin Bowling, produces the total score for the game.

You can launch tests of the class GameTU.class to see the results of the tests suggested in the statements.
PS : I used the values I saw in the statements, you can see it in the class RollValuesEnum.class if you want to test others cases.
